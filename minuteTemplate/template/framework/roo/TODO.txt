Comment on the roo console

primary key policy?
enum?
many2many intermediary table?
Explicit name of table for mapping.
roo console field type (mapping to DB type), exhaustive list.

Conventions to resolve ambiguities:
resolve ambiguity for dependencies. Entity A has two ONE_TO_MANY link with Entity B. 
It is not possible to have twice the same variable 'bs' twice. (Compilation uniqueness issue).

is ONE_TO_MANY bidirectional always. (implicit MANY_TO_ONE trigger).
what if we just want unidirectional?
